# Evo
Evolution, simulated.

## 5 conditions necessary for evolution
1. blueprints
2. selection
3. self-replication
4. inheritance
5. mutation

This simulation implements versions of them as a means for exploration.

## Running Things
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
