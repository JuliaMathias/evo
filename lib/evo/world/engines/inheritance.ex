  From wikipedia: In genetic algorithms, inheritance is the ability of modeled objects to mate, mutate (similar to
  biological mutation), and propagate their problem solving genes to the next generation, in order to produce an
  evolved solution to a particular problem.

  This process follows these basic steps:

  - Pair off successful objects for mating.
  - Determine randomly a crossover point for each pair.
  - Switch the genes after the crossover point in each pair.
  - Determine randomly if any genes are mutated in the child objects.
